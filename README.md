# singular-value-decomposition

This project was an exploration into the uses of singular value decomposition. It explores two uses: Image compression and character recognition.


Usage:

By running showingimages.py, the non-commented image file will be loaded and will then be compressed. It is then reconstructed to different degrees, showing the relative amount of storage required.
